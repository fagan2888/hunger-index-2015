<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p><strong>Here is how the GHI scores are calculated:</strong></p>
<h4><strong>STEP 1 -  Determine values for the component indicators:</strong></h4>
<table style="width:55%">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>PUN</td>

<td>proportion of the population that is undernourished (in %)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>PUN</td>

<td>prevalence of wasting in children under five years old (in %)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>CST</td>

<td>prevalence of stunting in children under five years old (in %)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>CM</td>

<td>proportion of children dying before the age of five (in %)</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

<h4><strong>STEP 2 - Standardize component indicators:</strong></h4>
<p>Standardized PUN = <sup>PUN</sup>⁄<sub>80</sub> x 100<br />
Standardized CWA = <sup>CWA</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub> x 100<br />
Standardized CST = <sup>CST</sup>⁄<sub>70</sub> x 100<br />
Standardized CM = <sup>CM</sup>⁄<sub>35</sub> x 100  </p>
<h4><strong>STEP 3 - Aggregate component indicators:</strong></h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> Standardized PUN<br />
+ <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> Standardized CWA<br />
+ <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> Standardized CST<br />
+ <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> Standardized CM  </p>
<hr />
<p>= GHI Score</p>
<p>GHI scores are calculated using a three-step process.</p>
<p>First, values for each of the four component indicators are determined from the available data for each country. The four indicators are</p>
<ul>
<li>the percentage of the population that is undernourished,</li>
<li>the percentage of children under five years old who suffer from wasting (low weight for height),</li>
<li>the percentage of children under five years old who suffer from stunting (low height for age), and</li>
<li>the percentage of children who die before the age of five (child mortality).</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, each of the four component indicators is given a standardized score based on thresholds set slightly above the highest country-level values observed worldwide for that indicator between 1988 and 2013.<sup>1</sup> For example, the highest value for undernourishment estimated in this period is 76.5 percent, so the threshold for standardization was set a bit higher, at 80 percent.<sup>2</sup> In a given year, if a country has an undernourishment prevalence of 40 percent, its <em>standardized</em> undernourishment score for that year is 50. In other words, that country is approximately halfway between having no undernourishment and reaching the maximum observed levels.</p>
<p>Third, the standardized scores are aggregated to calculate the GHI score for each country. Undernourishment and child mortality each contribute one-third of the GHI score, while the child undernutrition indicators–child wasting and child stunting–each contribute one-sixth of the score.</p>
<p>This calculation results in GHI scores on a 100-point scale where 0 is the best score (no hunger) and 100 the worst. In practice, neither of these extremes is reached. A value of 100 would signify that a country's undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality levels each exactly meet the thresholds set slightly above the highest levels observed worldwide in recent decades. A value of zero would mean that a country had no undernourished people in the population, no children younger than five who were wasted or stunted, and no children who died before their fifth birthday.</p>
<p><small><sup>1</sup>The thresholds for standardization are set slightly above the highest observed values in order to allow for the possibility that these values could be exceeded in the future.<br />
<sup>2</sup> The threshold for undernourishment is 80, based on the observed maximum of 76.5 percent; the threshold for child wasting is 30, based on the observed maximum of 26.0 percent; the threshold for child stunting is 70, based on the observed maximum of 68.2 percent; and the threshold for child mortality is 35, based on the observed maximum of 32.6 percent.</small></p>
<hr />
<p>The severity scale shows the severity of hunger–from low to extremely alarming–associated with the range of possible GHI scores using the revised formula.</p>
