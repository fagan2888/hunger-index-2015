        <h1>Global, Regional, and National Trends</h1>
<p>Since 2000, significant progress has been made in the fight against hunger.<sup id="fnref:hunger"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hunger" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The 2000 Global Hunger Index (GHI) score was 29.9 for the developing world, while the 2015 GHI score stands at 21.7, representing a reduction of 27 percent (Figure 2.1).<sup id="fnref:fig2.1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fig2.1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To put this in context, the higher the GHI score, the higher the level of hunger. Scores between 20.0 and 34.9 points are considered serious. Thus while. the GHI scores for the developing world—also referred to as the global GHI scores—for 2000 and 2015 are both in the serious category, the earlier score was closer to being categorized as alarming, while the later score is closer to the moderate category. As described in Chapter 1, all GHI calculations in this report, including those for the reference years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, have been calculated using a revised formula. The severity scale was adjusted to reflect this change.</p>
<p><img alt="GHI Chapter two figure one" src="http://library.ifpri.info/files/2015/10/ghi_2015_ch02_fig01.png" /></p>
<p>Despite the lower hunger level reflected by the 2015 global GHI score, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high. According to projections from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), about 795 million people worldwide—roughly one in nine—are estimated to be chronically undernourished in 2014–2016 (FAO, IFAD, and WFP 2015). As of 2013, 161 million children—approximately one in four—were stunted, and 51 million children suffered from wasting (UNICEF 2015b). Nearly half of all child deaths under age five are due to malnutrition, which claims the lives of about 3.1 million children per year (Black et al. 2013). Although substantial progress has been made, one need only look to the countries that still have serious or alarming hunger levels, the regions in any country that experience disproportionate hunger, or the children who will suffer lifelong consequences as a result of malnutrition early in life, to see that much work remains to be done.</p>
<p>In the developing world, the four GHI components (undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality) have each declined since 2000, although at different rates. The proportion of the population that is undernourished dropped 29 percent, from 18.5 percent to 13.1 percent. The prevalence of child stunting declined by 25 percent since 2000, going from 37.5 percent to 28.2 percent. The proportion of children who suffer wasting fell by 10 percent, going from 9.8 percent to 8.8 percent. Finally, the proportion of children dying before the age of five dropped by 40 percent, going from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent.<sup id="fnref:percent"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:percent" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<h2>Large Regional Differences</h2>
<p>The global averages mask dramatic differences among regions and countries. Africa south of the Sahara and South Asia have the highest 2015 GHI scores, at 32.2 and 29.4 respectively. Both reflect serious levels of hunger. In contrast, the GHI scores for East and Southeast Asia, Near East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States range between 8.0 and 13.2, and represent low or moderate levels of hunger.</p>
<p>In terms of absolute change, Africa south of the Sahara and South Asia have experienced the greatest improvements from the 2000 GHI to the 2015 GHI, with reductions of 12.4 and 8.8 points, respectively. East and Southeast Asia also reduced its GHI score by a sizeable amount, 7.4 points since the 2000 GHI. The Near East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States reduced their GHI scores by 4.4 to 5.8 points, despite already having the lowest 2000 GHI scores.</p>
<p>In terms of the percentage change since the 2000 GHI, two regions—Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States and Latin America and the Caribbean—experienced declines of just over 40 percent. East and Southeast Asia was not far behind, with a reduction of 36 percent. Africa south of the Sahara and the Near East and North Africa each reduced their GHI scores by 28 percent. Since 2000, South Asia’s GHI score dropped 23 percent. Given that the hunger level for Africa south of the Sahara stagnated between 1990 and 1995, it is notable that its GHI score has declined at a rate comparable to other regions’ rates since 2000.</p>
<p>South Asia’s GHI score declined at a moderate rate between 1990 and 2000, but then progress stalled between 2000 and 2005 before hunger levels dropped again between 2005 and 2015. This closely follows the trend of GHI scores for India, where nearly three-quarters of South Asia’s population lives. The decrease of more than 8 points in South Asia’s GHI score since 2005 may be largely attributed to recent successes in the fight against child undernutrition in India. According to the most recent data from India, wasting in children fell from 20 percent to 15 percent between 2005–2006 and 2013–2014, and stunting fell from 48 percent to 39 percent in the same period (IIPS and Macro International 2007; India, Ministry of Women and Child Development, and UNICEF 2014).<sup id="fnref:unicef2014"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unicef2014" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The government of India has scaled up nutrition-specific interventions over the past decade, including (1) a final drive to expand the Integrated Child Development Services program that aims to improve the health, nutrition, and development of children in India; and (2) the creation of the National Rural Health Mission, a community-based health initiative designed to deliver essential health services to rural India (Avula et al. 2013). However, progress in reducing child undernutrition has been uneven across India’s states. While the reasons for the improvements—or lack thereof—are not entirely clear, one factor that seems to correlate with undernutrition in India is open defecation, which contributes to illnesses that prevent the absorption of nutrients. Additionally, the low social status of women, which affects women’s health and nutrition, makes it more likely that babies will be born underweight (Economist 2015).</p>
<p>Africa south of the Sahara has the highest 2015 GHI score, at 32.2. Overall, since 2000, the region has experienced strong economic growth (UNCTAD 2014). It has also benefitted from advances in public health, including lower transmission levels and better treatment of HIV/AIDS, and fewer cases and deaths from malaria (AVERT 2014; WHO 2013). In some countries, such as Angola, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, the large-scale civil wars of the 1990s and 2000s have ended. These countries have become more politically stable and hunger levels have fallen substantially. On the other hand, countries such as the Central African Republic and Chad have experienced conflict more recently and also have experienced higher levels of hunger, although the causes of hunger are complex and cannot be attributed to conflict alone. Despite improvements, the high levels of hunger in Africa south of the Sahara, both regionally and in individual countries, are still cause for concern.</p>
<p>An issue of vital importance to Africa south of the Sahara is the link between agriculture and nutrition. More than two-thirds of the region’s population relies on agriculture for income, including more than 90 percent of the region’s extreme poor (O’Sullivan et al. 2014). Yet the area’s agricultural productivity levels are the lowest of any region in the world. The solutions for Africa will undoubtedly be complex, in part because ecological conditions and social circumstances vary throughout the continent. As part of the fight against hunger, organizations at all levels must continue to find ways to improve agricultural productivity, along with dietary diversity and environmental sustainability, in order to benefit the most vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Best and Worst Country-Level Results</h2>
<p>From the 2000 GHI to the 2015 GHI, 17 countries made remarkable progress, reducing their GHI scores by 50 percent or more. Sixty-eight countries made considerable progress with scores that dropped by between 25.0 percent and 49.9 percent, and 28 countries decreased their GHI scores by less than 25 percent. Despite this progress, 52 countries still suffer from serious or alarming levels of hunger.</p>
<p>Of the countries that achieved the 10 biggest percentage reductions in GHI scores from the 2000 GHI to the 2015 GHI, three are in South America (Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela), one is in Asia (Mongolia), four are former Soviet republics (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, and Ukraine), and two are former Yugoslav republics (Bosnia and Herzegovina plus Croatia). The GHI scores for each of these countries have declined significantly—between 53 and 71 percent since the 2000 GHI.</p>
<p>Brazil reduced its 2000 GHI score by roughly two-thirds. Its impressive progress was partially due to the government’s Zero Hunger program, which included Bolsa Família—a large-scale conditional cash transfer program. Bolsa Família contributed to decreased child mortality in Brazil, in part via improved nutrition, by requiring families to participate in health-related activities, including nutrition education, for pregnant and lactating women (Rasella et al. 2013). The Zero Hunger program also included programs to support family farms and increase the availability of fruits and vegetables (Rocha 2009). In 2009, Brazil met its Millennium Development Goal of reducing poverty and malnutrition by half—several years before the 2015 deadline. Yet, poor diet quality, overweight, and obesity remain challenges.</p>
<p>Peru made impressive progress by cutting its 2000 GHI score by 56 percent. Besides being one of Latin America’s fastest growing economies (World Bank 2015b), the country has gained recognition in recent years for its dedication to fighting hunger and undernutrition (Gillespie et al. 2013). During the 2006 and 2011 Peruvian presidential campaigns, the Initiative against Child Malnutrition (IDI), a broad alliance led by civil society organizations, put fighting chronic undernutrition on the campaign agenda, making all candidates pledge, if elected, to reduce child stunting by at least five percentage points in five years.</p>
<p>Consequently, President Alan García established a multisectoral agenda that helped reduce child stunting by nearly 10 percentage points to 18 percent between 2006 and 2011 (Acosta and Haddad 2014). After taking office in 2011 with a vow to eradicate poverty, President Ollanta Humala implemented the national Include to Grow strategy and established the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion to facilitate intersectoral coordination on issues including undernutrition. Despite recent progress, inequality is an ongoing challenge. In the last decade, in a sample of 53 countries in the developing world, Peru stood out as the country where child undernutrition levels were the most highly correlated with family socioeconomic status (Bredenkamp, Buisman, and Van de Poel 2014).</p>
<p>Mongolia also saw a 56 percent drop between its 2000 and 2015 GHI scores. In the period between 2000 and 2015, Mongolia experienced steady economic growth, with the exception of a brief downturn during the 2008 global financial crisis. The combination of economic growth, driven by rising mining and quarrying revenues, and social welfare programs, including a comprehensive national nutrition strategy to tackle undernutrition (UNICEF 2009b), coincided with decreased poverty and hunger levels in the period between 2000 and 2015, as well as reductions in the values of all the GHI component indicators. Yet poverty and undernutrition have persisted in Mongolia’s rural areas, particularly for small-scale livestock herders and their families, who are vulnerable to extreme weather patterns and environmental degradation (Mongolia 2013).</p>
<p>For the former Communist countries, the situation in each country is unique, yet certain trends emerge. For many of the former Soviet and Yugoslav states, the transition out of Communism to capitalism was rocky and characterized by recessions in the 1990s. Yet in the 2000s, economic growth was strong until the 2008 global financial crisis, which hit these countries particularly hard. The former Communist states have mostly recovered from the recession and reestablished modest economic growth, although negative impacts of the 2008 recession persist (Roaf et al. 2014).</p>
<p>For each of these countries, the relationship between macroeconomic growth, poverty, and hunger levels has differed. For example, in recent years, Azerbaijan’s economic growth has been driven by oil revenues. Government programs to boost wages, provide social protection, and invest in the public sector helped ensure that the economic benefits were dispersed throughout the population (UNDP 2012). Ukraine, too, has seen a reduction in poverty and hunger as GDP increased since 2000, yet significant inequality has left marginalized groups such as women, children, and the elderly vulnerable to hunger and poverty (Ukraine, Ministry of Economy 2010). Also, unrest in Ukraine between 2013 and early 2015 reportedly contributed to food shortages in the country (Lambers 2015; WFP 2015a). The effect of the unrest on hunger levels in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Rwanda, Angola, and Ethiopia have seen the biggest reductions in hunger, with GHI scores down by between 25 and 28 points in each country. Despite these improvements, the hunger levels in these countries are still serious. In fact, among the countries for which data were available, Rwanda, Angola, and Ethiopia had the three highest GHI scores in 2000 (58.5, 58.3, and 58.6, respectively), which explains why hunger levels are still high (30.3, 32.6, and 33.9), despite the remarkable reductions. These countries are also recovering from a legacy of civil war, and although it is not possible to directly attribute their hunger levels to the previous conflicts, they undoubtedly contributed to the challenges these countries face.</p>
<p>In Rwanda, poverty and hunger spiked after the country’s deadly civil war (1990–1993), which culminated in the Rwandan genocide in 1994. However, in the postwar period, Rwanda’s government has intentionally designed policies to promote inclusive economic growth, and the country has experienced increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) levels along with decreasing inequality, particularly since 2005–2006 (UNDP 2015). Rwanda’s child mortality rate was down to 5.2 percent as of 2013, and child wasting was 3.0 percent according to a 2010–2011 survey, suggesting that acute malnutrition has waned. However, child stunting was still high, at 44.3 percent.</p>
<p>Angola, too, is recovering from civil war. The country endured a 27-year struggle that ended in 2002 (World Bank 2015a). The country’s GDP increased substantially after the war’s end, primarily driven by increased oil revenues. The prevalence of undernourishment has decreased from 63.5 percent in 1990–1992 to 14.2 percent in 2014–2016 (FAO 2015). Yet, child mortality was still high, at 16.7 percent in 2013. Some claim that Angola’s problem is not a lack of food, but rather its dependence on food with little nutritional value, which in turn leads to child undernutrition and high child mortality (McClelland and Soque 2015).</p>
<p>Ethiopia experienced multiple, simultaneous civil wars between 1974 and 1991, along with severe famines during this period, including the worst famine in current history between 1983 and 1985 (Africa Watch 1991; von Braun and Olofinbiyi 2007). Its hunger situation remains serious, particularly for women and children. The government of Ethiopia has established several programs to address the issue, yet recurring droughts and the population’s heavy dependence on rainfed agriculture, which is plagued by low productivity levels, present ongoing challenges for food security (USAID 2014).</p>
<p>Only one country—Kuwait—experienced an increase in its score between 2000 and 2015. However, the increase, from a 4.2 score to a 5.0 score between the 2000 GHI and 2015 GHI, is small in absolute terms and Kuwait’s hunger level is still categorized as low. Most importantly, Kuwait’s 2015 score of 5.0 represents a dramatic improvement compared to 1990 and 1995, when its GHI scores were 24.3 (serious) and 16.1 (moderate) respectively. In fact, according to the 2014 GHI report, which compared 2014 scores with 1990 scores, Kuwait was the biggest “winner,” given that it experienced the largest percentage reduction in GHI scores among all the countries for which scores were calculated. The unusually high score in 1990 was due to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, which precipitated the first Gulf War. The evolution of Kuwait’s hunger levels should be evaluated in that context.</p>
<p><img alt="GHI Chapter two figure three" src="http://library.ifpri.info/files/2015/10/ghi_2015_ch02_fig03.png" /></p>
<p>Eight countries still suffer from levels of hunger that are alarming. The majority of those are in Africa south of the Sahara. The three exceptions are Afghanistan, Haiti, and Timor-Leste. In last year’s GHI report, based on the previous GHI formula, two countries had extremely alarming 2014 GHI scores—Burundi and Eritrea. Scores could not be calculated for these countries this year due to lack of data on undernourishment, but it is likely that they persist as hunger hot spots.</p>
<p>While no countries had extremely alarming levels of hunger (GHI scores of 50 points or more) according to 2015 GHI scores, many countries crossed this threshold in the reference years of this report—1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Examples of countries with extremely alarming hunger levels as recently as 2000 include Afghanistan, Niger, and Sierra Leone, to name but a few. That many countries now have less severe hunger ratings than they did in the past testifies to the progress made.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic, Chad, and Zambia have the highest 2015 GHI scores. Coupled with low percentage reductions in hunger levels since 2000, these countries merit our attention (Figure 2.3). The Central African Republic has been plagued by instability, dictatorships, and repeated coups since its independence from France in 1960. Most recently, beginning in 2013, fighting between disparate groups resulted in sizeable casualties and internal displacement of nearly 20 percent of the population (Arieff 2014).</p>
<p>Chad, too, has experienced instability in recent decades, due in part to conflicts with its neighbors and the influx of refugees from neighboring countries, such as Sudan and the Central African Republic (IDMC 2014). Zambia, on the other hand, has been relatively peaceful and democratic in recent history. Yet economically, the country is extremely poor and is heavily dependent on copper mining, which has led researchers to describe Zambia as an example of a country beset by the “resource curse” (Boos and Holm-Müller 2015). Resource curse theory posits that countries with abundant natural resources are plagued by slow growth (Sachs and Warner 2001), as well as inequality and poverty (Humphreys, Sachs, and Stiglitz 2007).</p>
<p>In terms of the GHI components, Haiti, Zambia, and the Central African Republic have the highest proportion of undernourished people, between 48 percent and 53 percent of the population. Timor-Leste, Burundi, and Eritrea have the highest prevalence of stunting (low height for age), with more than 50 percent of children under age five suffering from stunting. South Sudan, Djibouti, and Sri Lanka have the highest prevalence of wasting (low weight for height), with between 21 percent and 23 percent of children under age five affected. Angola, Sierra Leone, and Chad have the highest under-five mortality rates, ranging between 15 percent and 17 percent.</p>
<p>This year’s report does not include GHI scores for several countries that had very high (alarming or extremely alarming) GHI scores in the 2014 report, including Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, South Sudan, and Sudan, because current data on undernourishment were not available.<sup id="fnref:available"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:available" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In addition, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the highest GHI score of all countries in the 2011 GHI report, it has not been possible to calculate a GHI score for the country since 2011 due to missing data. GHI scores have never been calculated for Somalia due to data constraints, yet the World Food Programme considers it one of the most food insecure countries in the world (WFP 2015b). Although the lack of data obscures their hunger levels, the situations in these countries still merit great concern and must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>While the analysis in previous GHI reports focused on comparisons with hunger levels in 1990, the analysis in this year’s report centers on comparisons with hunger levels in 2000. Many countries experienced fluctuations between 1990 and 2015, and making comparisons with 2000 captures more recent trends.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hunger" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The regional and global aggregates for each component indicator are calculated as population-weighted averages, using the indicator values reported in Appendix B. Provisional estimates for undernourishment for Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, and Syria were used in the calculation of the global and regional aggregates only, but are not reported in Appendix B. These estimates are based on previously published undernourishment data and provisional estimates provided by FAO in 2014 for the sake of regional and global aggregation only. The regional and global GHI scores are calculated using the regional and global aggregates for each indicator and the revised formula described in Chapter 1.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fig2.1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
